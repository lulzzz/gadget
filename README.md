# Gadget - The streaming bot builder addon
Welcome to the gadget streaming bot builder addon.
I built this during the MVP Summit 2018 as an experiment. The goal is to find out
how to use Akka.NET streams to build a chatbot.

As this is an experiment I strongly encourage you to not use this code in production.
Other than that, feel free to copy, modify and use this code.

## Getting started
Follow these steps to get started with this code:

 * `git clone https://github.com/wmeints/gadget --recursive`
 * `dotnet build Gadget.sln`

To run tests please execute `dotnet test`
