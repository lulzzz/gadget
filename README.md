# Gadget - The streaming bot builder addon
Welcome to the gadget streaming bot builder addon.
I built this during the MVP Summit 2018 as an experiment. The goal is to find out
how to use Akka.NET streams to build a chatbot.

As this is an experiment I strongly encourage you to not use this code in production.
Other than that, feel free to copy, modify and use this code.
